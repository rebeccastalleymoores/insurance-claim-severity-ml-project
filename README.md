# Predicting Insurance Claim Severity Using Machine Learning

**Author:** Rebecca Stalley-Moores  
**Date:** 28/05/2025

## 📌 Overview

This project explores predictive modelling techniques to estimate the severity of insurance claims using the Allstate Claims Severity dataset. The goal is to compare multiple regression and ensemble learning models to support more accurate policy pricing and reserve planning — offering actionable insights for risk assessment in the insurance sector.
